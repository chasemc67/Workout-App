Challenge:
	[+] Save and load checked boxes to DB
	[+] Try multi-frame data entry page
	[+] Make multi-entry frame scrollable : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16188420/python-tkinter-scrollbar-for-frame
	[ ] Fix bug with saving checkboxes string
	[ ] Hard code page size (or at least width) so scrolling
		data entry page doesn't look so weird
	[ ] Search by name and by date in DB view
	[ ] Check for bad data in each entry frame before saving
	[ ] Results frames
	[ ] PDF report generator 

features:
	view results page
	edit fields from results page
	save to csv
	print to paper
	view existing people in list view


bugs:
	get tabbing between fields working
	Add safety so next button works when there arent any more frames
