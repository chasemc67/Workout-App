Challenge:

	[ ] (medium) Make the results from modular, so that we check if the person object's attribute != "" (doesn't equal empty string), and if it doesn't then we do the calculation and show the label for the thing.  For this part you'll probably need to use .pack rather than .grid for laying our the labels. You can google "tk pack vs grid" to see examples of how to do this.

	[ ] (hard) find a way to get the new results frame to show when a user hits the next button on the last data entry frame. Dont forget to import the frame in main, and add it to the list on line 56 where it says "for F in ..." 
	See line 85 in main.py for a hint in the comments

features:
	view results page
	edit fields from results page
	save to csv
	print to paper
	view existing people in list view


bugs:
	get tabbing between fields working
	Add safety so next button works when there arent any more frames
