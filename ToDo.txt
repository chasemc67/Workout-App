Challenge:

	[ ] Add if statements in results load function to display all the calculations depending on whether the data has been entered or not.

	[X] Add units for all labels

	[X] In calculation functions in Person make sure we're typecasting strings to floats (decimal numbers)
	so for example
	return (35.97 * self.distanceMiles) - 11.29
	becomes
	return (35.97 * float(self.distanceMiles)) - 11.29

	[X] Save data function on main page to save things like name and stuff

	[ ] Look up docs for tkinter pack. and understand how to use it to pack stuff pretty. 

features:
	view results page
	edit fields from results page
	save to csv
	print to paper
	view existing people in list view


bugs:
	get tabbing between fields working
	Add safety so next button works when there arent any more frames
